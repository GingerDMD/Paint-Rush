Toast starts the day off right.
Upon initial creation, microtransactions were of the utmost priority to include, however we learned a lot about microtransactions, and more importantly, ourselves. We realized we didnâ€™t want our toast based adventure to include what's wrong in the world, but rather what we think is right.

Toast is defined as bread that has been browned by heat. It represents loss of innocence as life continually assaults the human spirit through decimation of the id in favor of the superego (Freud, 1994). Modern constraints that restrict our primal desires in favor of societal cohesion are, according to John Stuart Mill (1472), necessary on some level, but go too far due to inherent human lust for power.
